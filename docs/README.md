# The Unofficial Guide to JanusVR

Inspired by the [Metaverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaverse) of Snow Crash and named after [Janus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janus), the Roman God of passages, [JanusVR](https://janusvr.com) transforms the internet into a world you can visit and build in. The analogy is that webpages are rooms, and links connect rooms via portals (doorways which seamlessly connect rooms). The experience draws you into this metaverse whether you are strapped to a headset or on the move with a tablet. Here is a passage which describes the god Janus from the novel "The Light Between Oceans" by M. L. Stedman:

> "You know Janus is where the word January comes from? It's named after the same god as this island. He's got two faces, back to back. Pretty ugly fellow." 
>
> "What's he god of?"
>
>  "Doorways. Always looking both ways, torn between two ways of seeing things. January looks forward to the new year and back to the old year. He sees past and future. And the island looks in the direction of two different oceans, down to the South Pole and up to the Equator."
 
To be precise about the meaning of the name Janus - it is in reference to the portals which are used to interconnect rooms. Like the Roman god Janus, a portal is a single object with two faces that can peer into two separate spaces. Pages with specially-crafted HTML show enhanced 3D content and interactive editing of these environments is possible. Site translators take content and structure of existing sites, generating environments from this data which arrange the content in a meaningful way. The experience is collaborative -- multiple people can navigate virtual spaces together, communicating via voice or text and sharing portals to new areas to explore as a group.

- Author content using existing 3D modeling tools, with our extended HTML and javascript
- Navigate using traditional gamer controls, touch, teleporting ghosts or 3D hand gestures
- Open source native and web clients, networking server, and tools for porting content
- Real-time physics, physically based rendering, spatialized audio
- Customize your Avatar
- Talk, chat and visually interact in 3D
- Surf the 2D web in 3D environments
