# Controls

These controls apply mostly to the native Janus client. JanusWeb follows the same control schemes to a close degree but more testing needs to be done.

If you're familiar with other first person experiences, you'll recognise the WASD control scheme that JanusVR defaults to. By pressing the W and S keys, you will move forwards and backwards. Likewise, the A and S keys will allow you to strafe.

### Edit Mode

Editing in Janus native is currently all powered by the keyboard and mouse. This graphic should help you out, we understand it takes some practice to get used to and aim to simplify things with a future version that also includes the classic gizmo.

### Gamepad

This control scheme is slightly dated as the portal (Y button) opens the 3D menu instead of a portal, and the start button doesn't do anything right now.
