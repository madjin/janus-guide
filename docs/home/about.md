# About

JanusVR combines the power of the internet with the potential of virtual reality. Websites become immersing spaces linked by portals, where users can explore, collaborate and create content on a platform that builds upon the open internet.

The internet is a flexible, integral part of everyone's life, and is used by most everyone on a daily basis. Through it, we are able to connect to our favourite websites, and experience content owned by various third parties across the world. This system has evolved over the decades, and with increases in processing power, it has taken the next step into the world of three dimensional content. JanusVR is one of the first practical attempts at utilizing the existing infrastructure of the internet as a content base for 3D environments.

## What Makes it Unique?

Most engines out there require that you compile your project and send copies of the executable to anyone who wishes to experience it. While this is an effective way of creating experiences if one has experience in programming, it is a very time consuming process that requires the end user to have the patience to sit down and wait until the experience finishes downloading both the content and its engine.

Another issue that comes out of this paradigm is the lack of interconnectivity between different projects, requiring that one launch separate executables in order to experience their content. JanusVR solves the problem of isolation in the digital age by bringing different, unique projects together in a seamless, multi-user environment. Essentially, JanusVR is a web browser for 3D content that allows people to add Javascript interactivity much in the same was as a traditional 2D browser.

## Content in JanusVR

JanusVR differs from other existing virtual worlds in that content made for it is hosted externally from itself. JanusVR exerts no control over the content its users create, as it would be impossible to regulate the internet in such a way. Anything you create for JanusVR exists on the domain of your choice.

Essentially, JanusVR is a looking glass into a new portion of the existing internet, rather than being some sort of centralized, virtual "government". Even the multi-user portion of JanusVR, (also known as the 'Presence Server') is decentralized, allowing content creators to specify their own presence server per room, and users to set their own 'fall-back server'. The default fall-back server allows those without their own presence server to experience collaboration in their creations.

## Inspiration

Inspired by the [Metaverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaverse) of [Snow Crash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow_Crash) and named after [Janus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janus), the Roman God of passages, JanusVR is an open source VR web browser that transforms the entire Internet into a place you can walk through and build in like a video game. The analogy is that webpages are rooms, and links connect rooms via portals (doorways which seamlessly connect rooms). The experience draws you into this metaverse whether you are strapped to a headset or on the move with a tablet. 

To be precise about the meaning of the name Janus - it is in reference to the portals which are used to interconnect rooms. Like the Roman god Janus, a portal is a single object with two faces that can peer into two separate spaces. Pages with specially-crafted HTML show enhanced 3D content and interactive editing of these environments is possible. Site translators take content and structure of existing sites, generating environments from this data which arrange the content in a meaningful way. The experience is collaborative -- multiple people can navigate virtual spaces together, communicating via voice or text and sharing portals to new areas to explore as a group.

Here is a passage which describes the god Janus from the novel "The Light Between Oceans" by M. L. Stedman:

> "You know Janus is where the word January comes from? It's named after the same god as this island. He's got two faces, back to back. Pretty ugly fellow."
>
> "What's he god of?"
>
>  "Doorways. Always looking both ways, torn between two ways of seeing things. January looks forward to the new year and back to the old year. He sees past and future. And the island looks in the direction of two different oceans, down to the South Pole and up to the Equator."
