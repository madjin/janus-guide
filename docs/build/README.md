# Build Introduction

JanusVR allows you to both browse and build immersive content. With an HTML-like language known as Janus Markup Language (JML), developers are able to easily create webspaces. Janus' Javascript support allows for dynamic and interactive webspaces. There are four main ways to build in JanusVR:

1. Interactively drag and drop immersive content right into Janus.
2. Modify existing template webspaces.
3. Learn to build JML and JS with a live coding editor in Janus.
4. Export content from various popular 3D game engines and modeling software.

## Interactive Editing

JanusVR has a built in editor that allows you to build rooms with other users. You **first enable edit mode** by opening the Main Menu (top right), click on the Settings button, and navigate to the Developer Tab. From here, you can enable edit mode. Editing only works in unlocked rooms.

The keys for movement are also used for editing when you select objects. I recommend first getting used to moving around with WASD, then try holding shift while walking to run and tap F to go into flight mode.

#### **Editing Controls**

Now lets go over some basic keycommands for editing [rmb/lmb + wasdqe + tab + 1234]: <http://janusvr.com/docs/build/interactiveediting/index.html>

To manipulate an object, right click to select (sometimes it's easier to hold down right click and let go when its over the object you want to select) then try pressing the keys QWEASD to move it around. The mouse can also be used to move things around but is usually less accurate.

Movement keys are slightly different for JanusWeb. When you right click to select an object in JanusWeb 1.5 you can press uiojkl to manipulate values and tab to scroll through various options such as position, rotation, scale.
